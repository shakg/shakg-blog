# Goal Setting and Tracking Framework
I’ve been using a framework for goal setting and tracking for some time now. I believe this framework, which involves writing down and following up on goals, has great potential in terms of clarity and simplicity. There are already dozens of frameworks and boilerplates for goal setting and habit management, but none of them stuck with me. Even though they were good, I never felt like I was setting a clear stage and moving forward from there.

So, I’ve created a simple yet effective set of guidelines to help you define your current situation, explore options, and create an action plan. Combining this framework with "retrospectives" should work—at least that’s my assumption.

> A retrospective is essentially looking back at the previous day, week, or month to evaluate what worked well and what didn’t. Take notes on them and try to avoid repeating mistakes in the next cycle.

Here’s a boilerplate you can easily create in Markdown, Word, or even Notepad.

```markdown
## Objective

Clearly state the goal you want to achieve and the time frame in which you aim to accomplish it. Be specific and measurable.

**Example**:

"I want to improve my physical fitness by losing 5kg within 3 months."

## Current State

Describe your current situation and where you are starting from. This section provides a baseline for measuring progress. Be honest and detailed about your strengths and weaknesses.

**Example**:

- "I currently exercise irregularly and lack consistency in my fitness routine."
- "My eating habits are inconsistent, with a high intake of processed foods."
- "I have not yet explored workout programs or developed a clear plan."

## Proposal

Outline the strategies and possible solutions you can pursue to achieve your objective. Break it down into actionable categories.

### Start to Exercise

- **Details of the Exercise Program**:
    
    Identify specific activities and routines that align with your goal. For example:
    
    - **Program Type**: A mix of strength training and aerobic exercises.
    - **Frequency**: Work out 4-5 times a week, alternating between cardio and strength sessions.
- **Program Options**:
    
    Research or list potential programs that can help achieve your objective. For example:
    
    - **Beginner Home Workout Plan**: Focus on bodyweight exercises (e.g., squats, push-ups, planks).
    - **Guided Classes**: Online platforms like YouTube (e.g., fitness influencers or programs like Chloe Ting, Joe Wicks).

### Start Reading Books About It

- **Book List**:
    
    Choose books that provide knowledge and motivation for achieving your goal. Example list:
    
    - *The 4-Hour Body* by Tim Ferriss
    - *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
- **Reading Plan**:
    
    Plan when, how, and where you'll read these books:
    
    - **When**: Every morning after breakfast for 30 minutes.
    - **Where**: In a quiet space like the living room or study.
    - **How**: Use a notebook to jot down key insights or actionable tips.

## Implementation

Create a clear and actionable implementation plan that details what steps you will take daily, weekly, and monthly to achieve your objective. Use this as a checklist to maintain accountability and momentum.

| **Daily** | **Weekly** | **Monthly** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum 30 minutes of reading. | Write a summary or blog post about progress. | Reflect on overall progress. |
| Track progress in a journal. | Review weekly actions and adjust as needed. | Refine plans and set new milestones. |
| 10 minutes of stretching. | Organize insights from books or exercises. | Measure key metrics like weight loss. |

## Reflection and Feedback

After completing the goal or reaching a significant milestone, take time to reflect on the process:

- **What worked well?**
- **What could be improved?**
- **What did you learn?**
```

You can obviously modify this template to suit your needs. Everyone is different, and generally, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.

Once you've defined the current state, objective, and possible solutions, the next step is to create an action plan and execute it. After you begin implementing, I recommend using "retrospectives" to reflect on the process. Simply sit down with a piece of paper and write about your experience—what went well, what didn’t, and how you can improve next time. For example, if you tried reading in the morning but found it difficult because you're not a morning person and stay up late most nights, note that in your retrospective and adjust the action plan accordingly.

> In my opinion, these types of documents should be live-documents. Actually, with a few exceptions, every document should be live and regularly refined. Our lives change rapidly, so should our processes and documents.
