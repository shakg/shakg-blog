# Goal Setting and Tracking Framework
There is a framework that I've using for some time. I think this framework of writing and following up with goals has some potential in terms of clearity & simplicity. There is already dozens of framework or boilerplates for goal setting and managing habits etc. but none of them sticked to me because even though they are good, I didn't get the fealing of setting the stage and moving forward from there. 

So I've created a simple yet effective headlines to give you current situation, couple of options as well as the action plan. Combining this framework with "retrospectives", will work, at least thats what I am assuming.

> Retrospective is basically, taking a look at the last day, week or month to see what has worked well and what doesn't. Taking notes on them and trying to avoid them in the next cycle.

Here is the boilerplate that you can easily create on markdown, word or even on notepad. 

```markdown
## Objective

Clearly state the goal you want to achieve and the time frame in which you aim to accomplish it. Be specific and measurable.

**Example**:

"I want to improve my physical fitness by losing 5kg within 3 months."

## Current State

Describe your current situation and where you are starting from. This section provides a baseline for measuring progress. Be honest and detailed about your strengths and weaknesses.

**Example**:

- "I currently exercise irregularly and lack consistency in my fitness routine."
- "My eating habits are inconsistent, with a high intake of processed foods."
- "I have not yet explored workout programs or developed a clear plan."

## Proposal

Outline the strategies and possible solutions you can pursue to achieve your objective. Break it down into actionable categories.

### Start to Exercise

- **Details of the Exercise Program**:
    
    Identify specific activities and routines that align with your goal. For example:
    
    - **Program Type**: A mix of strength training and aerobic exercises.
    - **Frequency**: Work out 4-5 times a week, alternating between cardio and strength sessions.
- **Program Options**:
    
    Research or list potential programs that can help achieve your objective. For example:
    
    - **Beginner Home Workout Plan**: Focus on bodyweight exercises (e.g., squats, push-ups, planks).
    - **Guided Classes**: Online platforms like YouTube (e.g., fitness influencers or programs like Chloe Ting, Joe Wicks).

### Start Reading Books About It

- **Book List**:
    
    Choose books that provide knowledge and motivation for achieving your goal. Example list:
    
    - *The 4-Hour Body* by Tim Ferriss
    - *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
- **Reading Plan**:
    
    Plan when, how, and where you'll read these books:
    
    - **When**: Every morning after breakfast for 30 minutes.
    - **Where**: In a quiet space like the living room or study.
    - **How**: Use a notebook to jot down key insights or actionable tips.

## Implementation

Create a clear and actionable implementation plan that details what steps you will take daily, weekly, and monthly to achieve your objective. Use this as a checklist to maintain accountability and momentum.

| **Daily** | **Weekly** | **Monthly** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum 30 minutes of reading. | Write a summary or blog post about progress. | Reflect on overall progress. |
| Track progress in a journal. | Review weekly actions and adjust as needed. | Refine plans and set new milestones. |
| 10 minutes of stretching. | Organize insights from books or exercises. | Measure key metrics like weight loss. |

## Reflection and Feedback

After completing the goal or reaching a significant milestone, take time to reflect on the process:

- **What worked well?**
- **What could be improved?**
- **What did you learn?**
```
You can obviously change it according to your needs. Everybody is different and generally, there is no one fits all solution.

When you define the current state, objective and the different types of solutions to achieve the objective, there is one thing to do, creating an action plan and executing it.
After you've started to make things go, I advise to reflect on that using "retrospectives", its just sitting in front of a paper and writing how was the experience, what was good and what was bad? How can you make it better? For example, you've tried to read a book in the morning but it was challenging because you are not a morning person and you are staying up late almost everynight. In the retrospectives you should note that and change the action plan according to feedback that you've written. 

> According to me, this types of documents should be *live-documents*. Actually, except for some rare kind of documents, every document should be live and should be refined regularly. Our life is changing rapidly so should our processes and documents. 

Anyways, couple of examples for making it clear in terms of what to write inside the blocks.
